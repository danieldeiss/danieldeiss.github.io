        <p class="coloredwhite left-align-text">This project is through my GIMM course at Boise State University and will be the final of the whole program. Currently I have finished with the game theory for the project and the thinking behind what I want it to roughly look like.
            This video is a mock-up of a very early version of the project. For the final version of the project I am aiming to have a multiplayer game that contains class selection, weapon pickups, and multiplayer. The game's main point will be to have a fun sandbox that 
            mixes fantasy/medieval weapons with weapons from modern times. The current version is mainly just a Unity example to show my concepts to others. 
            Most of the things used in this version are assets taken from Unity's store, but the final version will use fully custom textures, assets, and sounds.

        <p class="coloredwhite left-align-text">This project was made with the intention of presenting data from a Json and turning it into visible graphs and a chart. The Chart has all of the data in the Json showing in a chart form.
            The other part of the project, as shown in the video, was the graph part of the project. I worked alone on this project and was able to get the graphs showing the correct data from the Json and changing how they look depending on the data shown.
            This was my very first big project in HTML, CSS, and JS. I feel that it turned out pretty well, the only thing that I personally would edit in its current state is the positioning of the graph's keys and the positioning of where the graphs show the data when scrolled over.
            The use of D3.js was very interesting, and it is really cool what can be done with some of the many add-ons to base HTML and CSS. Bootstrap and D3 are very powerful tools, and it was very fun to learn how to use them for this project.
            This was a very fun begginner project and it taught me a lot about web development and setting up a data cite.
