        <p class="coloredwhite left-align-text">This project is through my GIMM course at Boise State University and
            will be the final of the whole program. Currently I have finished with the game theory for the project and
            the thinking behind what I want it to roughly look like.
            This video is a mock-up of a very early version of the project. For the final version of the project I am
            aiming to have a multiplayer game that contains class selection, weapon pickups, and multiplayer. The game's
            main point will be to have a fun sandbox that
            mixes fantasy/medieval weapons with weapons from modern times. The current version is mainly just a Unity
            example to show my concepts to others.
            Most of the things used in this version are assets taken from Unity's store, but the final version will use
            fully custom textures, assets, and sounds.

        <p class="coloredwhite left-align-text">This project was made with the intention of presenting data from a Json
            and turning it into visible graphs and a chart. The Chart has all of the data in the Json showing in a chart
            form.
            The other part of the project, as shown in the video, was the graph part of the project. I worked alone on
            this project and was able to get the graphs showing the correct data from the Json and changing how they
            look depending on the data shown.
            This was my very first big project in HTML, CSS, and JS. I feel that it turned out pretty well, the only
            thing that I personally would edit in its current state is the positioning of the graph's keys and the
            positioning of where the graphs show the data when scrolled over.
            The use of D3.js was very interesting, and it is really cool what can be done with some of the many add-ons
            to base HTML and CSS. Bootstrap and D3 are very powerful tools, and it was very fun to learn how to use them
            for this project.
            This was a very fun begginner project and it taught me a lot about web development and setting up a data
            cite.

        <p class="coloredwhite left-align-text">This project was made for two players to play together via the same keyboard. The idea of this project was to take random ideas and turn it into a two player game that can be interacted with and has a main objective.
            I ended up combining soccer and sword fighting together to make a game that has two main objectives. The first possible win condition is to hit the enemy player four times with your sword to win the game. The other win condition is to score a goal by pushing
            the soccer ball into the opposing player's net and this will count as an automatic victory. This project was made very quickly and took only about a week to make, but it was my very first 3D project in Unity and allowed for me to learn a lot about how the 3D functions in Unity work and operate.
            This was a very exciting project to work on as I learned a lot about Unity and I also had a lot of fun bringing an idea to life in a 3D space.

        <p class="coloredwhite left-align-text">For this project I worked with a partner on a small animation project about a young boy who awoke in the middle of the night and his journey to his father's room. We did a lot of story boarding for this project and we got a fairly good idea of what we wanted to make.
            We then did a text version of this project with no colors and some words to fill in for some scenes that would take longer to make. We then made backgrounds in Photoshop, collected sounds, and rigged in the character in animate. This project was pretty simple and did not take to long to make. It was one of the first
            animation projects that we worked on and went fairly well because we gave ourselves good amounts of time to get everything done. This project was a good way to test our skills with Photoshop, Animate, and Illustrate.
